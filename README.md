### Firefly Tech Test

## running the application
`git clone https://github.com/RichMatthews/firefly/`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

in another window:

`npm run watch`

notes:

There are some compromises in the design, for example I didn't want to waste time getting the exact colours as 
this would distract from more important code and functionality.
The code works and functionality is all there. But clearly to get it in to production would require unit testing and also
it could be refactored into smaller components and the methods could be refactored into 1 method. 
There is some other unecessary duplication, but again this would be quick and easy to refactor.
